# geomLib

This simple C library contains functions for some geometry formulas as the area of a trapezoid or circumference of a circle. This library works with float elements as, having multiplications and division, the output might have decimals.

The functions are the following:

---

- **sqr_per:**

Calculates the perimeter of a square given a side.
```
sqr_per(float side)
```

---

- **rect_per:**

Calculates the perimeter of a rectangle given a length and a width.
```
rect_per(float length, float width)
```

---

- **sqr_area:**

Calculates the area of a squeare given a side.
```
sqr_area(float side)
```

---

- **rect_area:**

Calculates the area of a rectangle given a length and a width.
```
rect_area(float length, float width)
```

---

- **trgl_area:**

Calculates the area of a triangle given a base and a height.
```
trgl_area(float base, float height)
```

---

- **trpzd_area:**

Calculates the area of a trapezoid given two bases and a height.
```
trpzd_area(float base1, float base2, float height)
```

---

- **circle_area:**

Calculates the area of a circle given a radius.
```
circle_area(float radius)
```

---

- **circle_diam:**

Calculates the diameter of a circle given a radius.
```
circle_diam(float radius)
```

---

- **circle_circum:**

Calculates the circumference of a circle given a radius.
```
circle_circum(float radius)
```
